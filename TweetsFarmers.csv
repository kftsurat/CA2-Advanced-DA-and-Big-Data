10/01/2022 06:32,1.38E+18,An independent press is critical to the health of a democracy. As the Indian govt continues to erode the freedoms of speech and press around the #FarmersProtest we look to @POTUS to follow in the footsteps of multiple elected officials and strongly condemn this behavior.
11/01/2022 06:32,1.38E+18,As a result news coverage by journalists and activists on social media platforms like @Twitter and online news outlets @thewire_in and @newslaundry have played a critical role in providing real-time reporting from the ground at the #FarmersProtest.
12/01/2022 06:32,1.38E+18,Since Nov the #FarmersProtest has united farmers across the country to take a stand for their livelihoods against farming bills the Indian govt rushed to pass. In its anti-democratic response the govt has tried to paint protestors as \u201canti-national\u201d through media narratives.
